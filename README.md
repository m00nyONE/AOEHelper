# AOEHelper

### Ever had the Problem that you can not see an AOE on the floor because the environment and/or groundcolors change from trial to trial? Then this addon is for you!

### This addon allows you to customize the colors of enemy and friendly AOEs in trials and dungeons as well as their brightness values. You can save these and they will be loaded automatically when you enter the trial/dungeon.
